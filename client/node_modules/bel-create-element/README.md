# bel-create-element

Fork of a simple library for composable DOM elements using [tagged template strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

This fork includes just the bel-create-element function. It does not include
hyperx, and therefore should produce smaller builds.

For documentation, please look at the [original project's readme](https://github.com/shama/bel/)
_Note: this project is a fork of bel@4.6.1, and then a mish-mashed update to be something close to bel@5.1.3, it may be completely similar, and it may be completely broken. Use at own risk._
